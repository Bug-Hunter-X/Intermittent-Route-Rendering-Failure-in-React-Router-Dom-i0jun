# React Router Dom Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom where routes fail to render correctly under certain conditions, specifically when nesting routes or using wildcard routes alongside other routes. The issue is intermittent and difficult to consistently reproduce.

## Bug Description

Routes defined in the `Routes` component sometimes do not render their corresponding components, leading to a blank screen or an unexpected component being displayed.  This seems to be more prevalent when nesting routes or using a wildcard route (`*`) in combination with other specific routes. The inconsistency of the problem makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to different routes. The issue manifests itself inconsistently, so you may need to refresh the page several times or change routes in a specific order to observe it.

## Solution

The provided solution involves checking for a potential conflict with other libraries, or browser extensions.  If that doesn't resolve the issue, examine the route definitions for potential conflicts and ensure proper nesting.
